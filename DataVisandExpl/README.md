# Folder contents

The DataVisandExpl folder contains everything about a data that I have explored and then visualized.

Currently:
 - **R-app3**: contains the data and scripts to make the shiny app. The app visualizes the data of DOHMH dataset.
 - **PythonScrapper**: contains scrap data from 3 sources.
